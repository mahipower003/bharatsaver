      {
        "question": "Can I deposit monthly or annually?",

      {
        "question": "Deposits made after the 5th of the month — do they earn interest?",
        "answer": "No. Deposits must be made before the 5th to earn interest for that month. This detail can add substantial interest over time."

      {
        "question": "When can I withdraw from PPF?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Is the maturity amount from PPF tax-free?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can NRIs invest in PPF?",

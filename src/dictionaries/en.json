      { "question": "Can I extend my PPF after 15 years?", "answer": "Yes, you can extend your PPF account in blocks of 5 years with or without making further contributions. An extended account with contributions continues to earn tax-free interest on the entire balance." },
      { "question": "Can I open multiple PPF accounts?", "answer": "No, an individual can only open one PPF account in their name." },
      { "question": "How is PPF interest calculated monthly?", "answer": "Interest is calculated on the lowest balance between the close of the fifth day and the last day of every month. However, the interest is credited to the account only at the end of the financial year." },
      { "question": "Is there any penalty for missed deposits?", "answer": "If you fail to deposit the minimum amount of â‚¹500 in a financial year, the account becomes inactive. You can reactivate it by paying a penalty of â‚¹50 per year of inactivity, along with the minimum deposit for each inactive year." },
      { "question": "How is PPF different from Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY)?", "answer": "PPF is a general long-term savings scheme for any resident Indian, while SSY is specifically designed for the financial security of a girl child.

        },
        {
            "question": "How is SSY interest calculated?",
            "answer": "SSY compounds annually. For regular annual deposits, calculate each yearâ€™s deposit growth until maturity and sum them. Use A = P(1+r)^(years)."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the minimum and maximum deposit in SSY?",
            "answer": "Minimum deposit is <strong>â‚¹250 per year</strong> and maximum deposit is <strong>â‚¹1.5 lakh per year</strong>."

        },
        {
            "question": "How to revive an SSY account â€” step by step?",
            "answer": "If you miss the minimum â‚¹250 deposit, your account becomes inactive. To revive it, visit your bank/Post Office, fill the revival form, and pay the total missed deposits (â‚¹250 per year) plus a small penalty for each missed year. Your account will become active again."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does depositing on the 5th vs 6th affect SSY interest?",
            "answer": "Interest is calculated on the lowest balance between the 5th and the end of the month. Depositing before the 5th ensures your money earns interest for that entire month. If you deposit after, you lose interest for that month on that specific deposit."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can NRIs open an SSY account?",
            "answer": "No, only resident Indian parents or legal guardians can open an SSY account for a girl child. If the girl child acquires NRI status after the account is opened, the account may be closed prematurely."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the nomination and transfer rules?",
            "answer": "You can nominate a beneficiary for the SSY account. The account can also be transferred from one bank/Post Office to another anywhere in India if the family relocates."
        },
        {
            "question": "What happens if the parent/guardian dies?",
            "answer": "In the unfortunate event of the depositor's (parent/guardian's) death, the account can be continued by the other parent or legal guardian. If not possible, the account is typically closed, and the balance with interest is paid to the girl child's nominee or legal heir."

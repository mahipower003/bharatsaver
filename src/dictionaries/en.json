      { "question": "Can I extend my PPF after 15 years?", "answer": "Yes, you can extend your PPF account in blocks of 5 years with or without making further contributions. An extended account with contributions continues to earn tax-free interest on the entire balance." },
      { "question": "Can I open multiple PPF accounts?", "answer": "No, an individual can only open one PPF account in their name." },
      { "question": "How is PPF interest calculated monthly?", "answer": "Interest is calculated on the lowest balance between the close of the fifth day and the last day of every month. However, the interest is credited to the account only at the end of the financial year." },

      { "question": "What is Atal Pension Yojana (APY)?", "answer": "APY is a government social-security pension scheme that guarantees a fixed monthly pension between ‚Çπ1,000 and ‚Çπ5,000 to subscribers after they reach 60. It‚Äôs administered by the PFRDA and aimed primarily at the unorganized sector." },
      { "question": "Who is eligible for APY?", "answer": "Any Indian citizen aged 18‚Äì40 with a valid bank account and KYC documents can join APY. Check your bank for enrollment steps." },
      { "question": "How is the APY premium calculated?", "answer": "Premiums are fixed by official actuarial tables based on entry age and the pension amount you choose. Use our APY Calculator or download the premium chart to see the exact monthly premium for your age." },
      { "question": "How much do I have to pay for ‚Çπ3,000 pension?", "answer": "Find the exact amount in the premium chart above. Example: at age 25 a ‚Çπ3,000 pension requires ‚Çπ226/month (per the table shown)." },
      { "question": "Can I join APY if I pay income tax?", "answer": "Rules may vary over time. Historically APY targeted the unorganized sector; check PFRDA or your bank for the current policy regarding income-tax payers." },
      { "question": "What happens if I miss a payment?", "answer": "Missed payments may attract small penalties and eventual account inactivation. Banks typically provide revival procedures ‚Äî pay missed premiums plus any penalty to reactivate the account." },
      { "question": "Can I withdraw from APY before age 60?", "answer": "Early exit is restricted ‚Äî allowed only in exceptional situations (e.g., critical illness or death) and may involve penalties. See the official PFRDA rules or your bank‚Äôs APY terms." },
      { "question": "Is there any government co-contribution?", "answer": "For certain eligible subscribers, government co-contribution schemes have been offered in the past. Verify current schemes and eligibility on PFRDA/NSDL pages." },
      { "question": "What happens to the corpus on subscriber‚Äôs death?", "answer": "On the subscriber‚Äôs death, the spouse typically receives the same pension; if both are deceased, the nominee receives the accumulated corpus per scheme rules." },
      { "question": "Are APY contributions tax deductible?", "answer": "APY offers pension benefits and not direct extra 80C allowances; check Income Tax rules for current tax treatments. (Always verify with the Income Tax Dept. for the latest tax guidance.)" },
      { "question": "How do I enroll in APY?", "answer": "Visit your bank branch or use your bank‚Äôs online banking if they provide APY enrollment. You‚Äôll need your bank account, Aadhaar, PAN (if required) and KYC." },
      { "question": "APY vs NPS ‚Äî which should I choose?", "answer": "APY is a guaranteed small pension product focused on basic security; NPS is market-linked with higher potential returns and greater flexibility. Choose APY if you want guaranteed fixed pension and low complexity; choose NPS if you want higher potential growth and are comfortable with market risks." }

        { "question": "FD vs PPF ‚Äî which is better?", "answer": "It depends: PPF is better for long-term, tax-free growth; FD is better for short-term goals and liquidity. Use the calculator to compare the exact numeric outcome for your inputs." },
        { "question": "How to calculate FD returns after tax?", "answer": "Compute FD future value with compound interest, subtract the original principal to get interest earned, then apply your marginal tax rate to that interest to find tax owed. Post-tax maturity = gross maturity ‚àí tax." },
        { "question": "How is PPF interest calculated?", "answer": "PPF interest is compounded annually at the rate notified quarterly by the government. If you deposit at the start of each year (annuity-due), the formula uses an annuity multiplier." },
        { "question": "What if I want to compare equal total investments?", "answer": "This feature is coming soon. Currently, the tool compares a one-time FD investment against a recurring PPF investment, which is a common real-world scenario." },
        { "question": "Does PPF allow early withdrawals?", "answer": "Partial withdrawals are permitted from the 7th financial year under limits; loans are available between years 3 and 6. Full premature closure is allowed only in specific cases (e.g., serious illness) and may carry a penalty." },
        { "question": "Is FD interest taxable?", "answer": "Yes ‚Äî FD interest is taxable at your marginal income tax slab. TDS (10%) is applicable above statutory thresholds; however, actual tax liability will depend on your slab." },
        { "question": "Can I claim tax benefits for FD?", "answer": "Only 5-year tax-saving FDs qualify for deduction under Section 80C; their interest remains taxable." },
        { "question": "Should a senior citizen choose FD or PPF?", "answer": "Many seniors use a mix ‚Äî FDs for monthly income (banks give senior citizen rates) and PPF if they want a tax-free long-term corpus. The calculator helps quantify trade-offs." },
        { "question": "What happens if I miss a PPF deposit?", "answer": "Missing the minimum contribution makes the account inactive; revival requires payment for missed years plus a penalty per missed year. Check your bank/Post Office for exact revival process." },
        { "question": "Are PPF rates fixed forever?", "answer": "No ‚Äî PPF rates are reviewed and notified by the government quarterly. The calculator allows you to edit the rate to model different scenarios." },
        { "question": "Can NRIs open PPF accounts?", "answer": "NRIs cannot open new PPF accounts; existing accounts continue under specific conditions. Confirm current rules with the bank/Post Office and official guidelines." },
        { "question": "How can I use FD laddering with PPF?", "answer": "A common strategy: max out PPF for tax-free long-term growth, and ladder FDs with staggered maturities for liquidity. This balances safety, liquidity and tax efficiency." }

    "conclusion": {
      "title": "Final Thoughts: Making the Right Choice",
      "body": "Choosing between a Fixed Deposit and the Public Provident Fund ultimately depends on your financial goals, investment horizon, and need for liquidity. For secure, tax-free, long-term growth, PPF is an unmatched tool. For predictable returns on short-term savings, an FD provides reliability and access.

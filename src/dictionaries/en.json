      { "question": "Can I extend my PPF after 15 years?", "answer": "Yes, you can extend your PPF account in blocks of 5 years with or without making further contributions. An extended account with contributions continues to earn tax-free interest on the entire balance." },
      { "question": "Can I open multiple PPF accounts?", "answer": "No, an individual can only open one PPF account in their name." },

      { "question": "What is Atal Pension Yojana (APY)?", "answer": "APY is a government social-security pension scheme that guarantees a fixed monthly pension between ₹1,000 and ₹5,000 to subscribers after they reach 60. It’s administered by the PFRDA and aimed primarily at the unorganized sector." },
      { "question": "Who is eligible for APY?", "answer": "Any Indian citizen aged 18–40 with a valid bank account and KYC documents can join APY. Check your bank for enrollment steps." },
      { "question": "How is the APY premium calculated?", "answer": "Premiums are fixed by official actuarial tables based on entry age and the pension amount you choose. Use our APY Calculator or download the premium chart to see the exact monthly premium for your age." },
      { "question": "How much do I have to pay for ₹3,000 pension?", "answer": "Find the exact amount in the premium chart above. Example: at age 25 a ₹3,000 pension requires ₹226/month (per the table shown)." },
      { "question": "Can I join APY if I pay income tax?", "answer": "Rules may vary over time. Historically APY targeted the unorganized sector; check PFRDA or your bank for the current policy regarding income-tax payers." },
      { "question": "What happens if I miss a payment?", "answer": "Missed payments may attract small penalties and eventual account inactivation. Banks typically provide revival procedures — pay missed premiums plus any penalty to reactivate the account." },
      { "question": "Can I withdraw from APY before age 60?", "answer": "Early exit is restricted — allowed only in exceptional situations (e.g., critical illness or death) and may involve penalties. See the official PFRDA rules or your bank’s APY terms." },
      { "question": "Is there any government co-contribution?", "answer": "For certain eligible subscribers, government co-contribution schemes have been offered in the past. Verify current schemes and eligibility on PFRDA/NSDL pages." },
      { "question": "What happens to the corpus on subscriber’s death?", "answer": "On the subscriber’s death, the spouse typically receives the same pension; if both are deceased, the nominee receives the accumulated corpus per scheme rules." },
      { "question": "Are APY contributions tax deductible?", "answer": "APY offers pension benefits and not direct extra 80C allowances; check Income Tax rules for current tax treatments. (Always verify with the Income Tax Dept. for the latest tax guidance.)" },
      { "question": "How do I enroll in APY?", "answer": "Visit your bank branch or use your bank’s online banking if they provide APY enrollment. You’ll need your bank account, Aadhaar, PAN (if required) and KYC." },
      { "question": "APY vs NPS — which should I choose?", "answer": "APY is a guaranteed small pension product focused on basic security; NPS is market-linked with higher potential returns and greater flexibility. Choose APY if you want guaranteed fixed pension and low complexity; choose NPS if you want higher potential growth and are comfortable with market risks." }

        { "question": "FD vs PPF — which is better?", "answer": "It depends: PPF is better for long-term, tax-free growth; FD is better for short-term goals and liquidity. Use the calculator to compare the exact numeric outcome for your inputs." },
        { "question": "How to calculate FD returns after tax?", "answer": "Compute FD future value with compound interest, subtract the original principal to get interest earned, then apply your marginal tax rate to that interest to find tax owed. Post-tax maturity = gross maturity − tax." },
        { "question": "How is PPF interest calculated?", "answer": "PPF interest is compounded annually at the rate notified quarterly by the government. If you deposit at the start of each year (annuity-due), the formula uses an annuity multiplier." },
        { "question": "What if I want to compare equal total investments?", "answer": "This feature is coming soon. Currently, the tool compares a one-time FD investment against a recurring PPF investment, which is a common real-world scenario." },
        { "question": "Does PPF allow early withdrawals?", "answer": "Partial withdrawals are permitted from the 7th financial year under limits; loans are available between years 3 and 6. Full premature closure is allowed only in specific cases (e.g., serious illness) and may carry a penalty." },
        { "question": "Is FD interest taxable?", "answer": "Yes — FD interest is taxable at your marginal income tax slab. TDS (10%) is applicable above statutory thresholds; however, actual tax liability will depend on your slab." },
        { "question": "Can I claim tax benefits for FD?", "answer": "Only 5-year tax-saving FDs qualify for deduction under Section 80C; their interest remains taxable." },
        { "question": "Should a senior citizen choose FD or PPF?", "answer": "Many seniors use a mix — FDs for monthly income (banks give senior citizen rates) and PPF if they want a tax-free long-term corpus. The calculator helps quantify trade-offs." },
        { "question": "What happens if I miss a PPF deposit?", "answer": "Missing the minimum contribution makes the account inactive; revival requires payment for missed years plus a penalty per missed year. Check your bank/Post Office for exact revival process." },
        { "question": "Are PPF rates fixed forever?", "answer": "No — PPF rates are reviewed and notified by the government quarterly. The calculator allows you to edit the rate to model different scenarios." },
        { "question": "Can NRIs open PPF accounts?", "answer": "NRIs cannot open new PPF accounts; existing accounts continue under specific conditions. Confirm current rules with the bank/Post Office and official guidelines." },
        { "question": "How can I use FD laddering with PPF?", "answer": "A common strategy: max out PPF for tax-free long-term growth, and ladder FDs with staggered maturities for liquidity. This balances safety, liquidity and tax efficiency." }

    "conclusion": {
      "title": "Final Thoughts: Making the Right Choice",

It's perfect for building wealth steadily over time. For even faster growth, consider a <strong>step-up SIP</strong>, where you increase your monthly investment amount annually, usually in line with your salary hike (e.g., by 10%).</p><h3>Asset Allocation by Age</h3><p>Your investment strategy shouldn't be static. As you get closer to retirement, you should gradually shift from high-risk, high-return assets to safer options to protect your capital.</p><ul><li><strong>In your 20s & 30s:</strong> Be aggressive. A portfolio with 70-80% in equities (like mutual funds) can generate higher returns over the long term.</li><li><strong>In your 40s:</strong> Start balancing your risk. A 60:40 split between equity and debt is a common strategy.</li><li><strong>In your 50s and beyond:</strong> It's time to preserve your capital. Shift your portfolio to be debt-heavy (70-80% in fixed-income instruments).</li></ul><h3>How PPF, NPS, & EPF Fit into Your Plan</h3><p>These are the foundation pillars of retirement planning in India.

      { "question": "What inflation rate should I use for Indian retirement planning?", "answer": "Many planners use a long-term default of 5–7% for India; 6% is common. Use higher rates for conservative healthcare or long horizon assumptions." },
      { "question": "Can I include EPF, PPF and NPS in my retirement corpus?", "answer": "Yes — include all liquid and pension assets (EPF, PPF, NPS, mutual funds, bank FD) in your Current Savings input to lower the additional SIP needed." },
      { "question": "How much should a 30-year-old save monthly to retire comfortably?", "answer": "It depends on the target corpus and assumptions. As a rough guide, saving ₹15,000–₹25,000/month can build a multi-crore corpus by 60 at 10–12% returns. Use the calculator for precise numbers." },
      { "question": "Should I invest by SIP or lump sum to reach my retirement goal?", "answer": "SIP is recommended for disciplined investing and rupee-cost averaging; a lump sum can outperform in long bull markets but has a higher timing risk. A blended approach works for many." },
      { "question": "What is a safe withdrawal rate in India during retirement?", "answer": "There is no one-size-fits-all; many advisors use a 3–4% initial withdrawal rule (adjusted for inflation). Consider conservative withdrawal rates if longevity or healthcare costs are uncertain." },

      { "question": "How long should my retirement corpus last?", "answer": "Typically planners assume a life expectancy of 85–90 years. Use conservative longevity assumptions if family longevity is high or you retire early." },
      { "question": "Does the calculator account for post-retirement returns?", "answer": "Yes — you can set a lower, conservative post-retirement return (e.g., 6–8%) to model how the corpus will be invested and sustain withdrawals." },

      "body": "If you find high overlap, don't panic. Consider replacing one of the funds with another that has a different strategy or market-cap focus. For instance, if two large-cap funds overlap, you could switch one to a mid-cap or sector-specific fund to achieve true diversification."

      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "faqs": [
        { "q": "How is mutual fund overlap calculated?", "a": "We calculate weighted overlap by summing the minimum weight of each common stock held by two funds. The formula is: Σ min(Weight_Fund_A, Weight_Fund_B) for all common stocks." },
        { "q": "Is 30% overlap in mutual funds bad?", "a": "A 30% overlap is considered high. While not necessarily 'bad', it suggests you might be paying two expense ratios for very similar holdings, which reduces diversification. It's worth reviewing if both funds are needed for your portfolio." },
        { "q": "How do you check for overlap in mutual funds?", "a": "Simply select 2 to 5 Indian equity funds from the dropdown menus in our calculator. The tool will automatically fetch the latest holdings data and calculate the pairwise overlap for you." },
        { "q": "What type of funds have the most overlap?", "a": "Large-cap and index funds tend to have the most overlap because they track similar benchmarks (like the NIFTY 50 or Sensex) and invest in the same set of top blue-chip companies." }

While we strive for accuracy, we cannot guarantee it. Always verify with official AMC factsheets. <strong>Last Updated: August 2025.</strong></p><p><strong>Matching Logic:</strong> Holdings are first matched by their stock ticker (e.g., 'RELIANCE'). If a ticker is unavailable, we use a normalized company name (e.g., 'reliance industries' after removing 'Ltd', 'Inc', etc.). Non-equity holdings like 'Cash', 'Triparty Repo', or 'Net Receivables' are excluded from calculations based on a regex match for common terms.</p><p><strong>Worked Example (Weighted Overlap):</strong></p><p>Weighted Overlap = Σ min(Weight in Fund A, Weight in Fund B) for all common stocks.</p><div class='overflow-x-auto'><table class='w-full text-sm my-4'><thead><tr class='border-b'><th class='text-left p-2'>Stock</th><th class='text-right p-2'>Fund A (w%)</th><th class='text-right p-2'>Fund B (w%)</th><th class='text-right p-2'>Min.

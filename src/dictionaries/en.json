      { "question": "Can I extend my PPF after 15 years?", "answer": "Yes, you can extend your PPF account in blocks of 5 years with or without making further contributions. An extended account with contributions continues to earn tax-free interest on the entire balance." },
      { "question": "Can I open multiple PPF accounts?", "answer": "No, an individual can only open one PPF account in their name." },
      { "question": "How is PPF interest calculated monthly?", "answer": "Interest is calculated on the lowest balance between the close of the fifth day and the last day of every month. However, the interest is credited to the account only at the end of the financial year." },

        "<strong>Pro-Tip: Deposit before the 5th of the month.</strong> Interest is calculated on the lowest balance between the 5th and the end of the month, so depositing early ensures you earn interest for that entire month.",

        "answer": "Interest for any month is calculated on the lowest balance recorded between the 5th and the last day of that month. By depositing before the 5th, you ensure your money earns interest for that entire month. If you deposit after the 5th, you lose out on one month's interest for that specific deposit."

    "faqs": [
      { "question": "What is Atal Pension Yojana (APY)?", "answer": "APY is a government social-security pension scheme that guarantees a fixed monthly pension between ₹1,000 and ₹5,000 to subscribers after they reach 60. It’s administered by the PFRDA and aimed primarily at the unorganized sector." },
      { "question": "Who is eligible for APY?", "answer": "Any Indian citizen aged 18–40 with a valid bank account and KYC documents can join APY. Check your bank for enrollment steps." },
      { "question": "How is the APY premium calculated?", "answer": "Premiums are fixed by official actuarial tables based on entry age and the pension amount you choose. Use our APY Calculator or download the premium chart to see the exact monthly premium for your age." },
      { "question": "How much do I have to pay for ₹3,000 pension?", "answer": "Find the exact amount in the premium chart above. Example: at age 25 a ₹3,000 pension requires ₹226/month (per the table shown)." },
      { "question": "Can I join APY if I pay income tax?", "answer": "Rules may vary over time. Historically APY targeted the unorganized sector; check PFRDA or your bank for the current policy regarding income-tax payers." },
      { "question": "What happens if I miss a payment?", "answer": "Missed payments may attract small penalties and eventual account inactivation. Banks typically provide revival procedures — pay missed premiums plus any penalty to reactivate the account." },
      { "question": "Can I withdraw from APY before age 60?", "answer": "Early exit is restricted — allowed only in exceptional situations (e.g., critical illness or death) and may involve penalties. See the official PFRDA rules or your bank’s APY terms." },
      { "question": "Is there any government co-contribution?", "answer": "For certain eligible subscribers, government co-contribution schemes have been offered in the past. Verify current schemes and eligibility on PFRDA/NSDL pages." },
      { "question": "What happens to the corpus on subscriber’s death?", "answer": "On the subscriber’s death, the spouse typically receives the same pension; if both are deceased, the nominee receives the accumulated corpus per scheme rules." },
      { "question": "Are APY contributions tax deductible?", "answer": "APY offers pension benefits and not direct extra 80C allowances; check Income Tax rules for current tax treatments. (Always verify with the Income Tax Dept. for the latest tax guidance.)" },
      { "question": "How do I enroll in APY?", "answer": "Visit your bank branch or use your bank’s online banking if they provide APY enrollment. You’ll need your bank account, Aadhaar, PAN (if required) and KYC." },
      { "question": "APY vs NPS — which should I choose?", "answer": "APY is a guaranteed small pension product focused on basic security; NPS is market-linked with higher potential returns and greater flexibility. Choose APY if you want guaranteed fixed pension and low complexity; choose NPS if you want higher potential growth and are comfortable with market risks." }

    "faq_title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqs": [
        { "question": "FD vs PPF — which is better?", "answer": "It depends: PPF is better for long-term, tax-free growth; FD is better for short-term goals and liquidity. Use the calculator to compare the exact numeric outcome for your inputs." },
        { "question": "How to calculate FD returns after tax?", "answer": "Compute FD future value with compound interest, subtract the original principal to get interest earned, then apply your marginal tax rate to that interest to find tax owed. Post-tax maturity = gross maturity − tax." },
        { "question": "How is PPF interest calculated?", "answer": "PPF interest is compounded annually at the rate notified quarterly by the government. If you deposit at the start of each year (annuity-due), the formula uses an annuity multiplier." },
        { "question": "What if I want to compare equal total investments?", "answer": "This feature is coming soon. Currently, the tool compares a one-time FD investment against a recurring PPF investment, which is a common real-world scenario." },
        { "question": "Does PPF allow early withdrawals?", "answer": "Partial withdrawals are permitted from the 7th financial year under limits; loans are available between years 3 and 6. Full premature closure is allowed only in specific cases (e.g., serious illness) and may carry a penalty." },
        { "question": "Is FD interest taxable?", "answer": "Yes — FD interest is taxable at your marginal income tax slab. TDS (10%) is applicable above statutory thresholds; however, actual tax liability will depend on your slab." },
        { "question": "Can I claim tax benefits for FD?", "answer": "Only 5-year tax-saving FDs qualify for deduction under Section 80C; their interest remains taxable." },
        { "question": "Should a senior citizen choose FD or PPF?", "answer": "Many seniors use a mix — FDs for monthly income (banks give senior citizen rates) and PPF if they want a tax-free long-term corpus. The calculator helps quantify trade-offs." },
        { "question": "What happens if I miss a PPF deposit?", "answer": "Missing the minimum contribution makes the account inactive; revival requires payment for missed years plus a penalty per missed year. Check your bank/Post Office for exact revival process." },
        { "question": "Are PPF rates fixed forever?", "answer": "No — PPF rates are reviewed and notified by the government quarterly. The calculator allows you to edit the rate to model different scenarios." },
        { "question": "Can NRIs open PPF accounts?", "answer": "NRIs cannot open new PPF accounts; existing accounts continue under specific conditions. Confirm current rules with the bank/Post Office and official guidelines." },
        { "question": "How can I use FD laddering with PPF?", "answer": "A common strategy: max out PPF for tax-free long-term growth, and ladder FDs with staggered maturities for liquidity. This balances safety, liquidity and tax efficiency." }
    ],
    "conclusion": {
      "title": "Final Thoughts: Making the Right Choice",
      "body": "Choosing between a Fixed Deposit and the Public Provident Fund ultimately depends on your financial goals, investment horizon, and need for liquidity. For secure, tax-free, long-term growth, PPF is an unmatched tool. For predictable returns on short-term savings, an FD provides reliability and access.

The overlap is calculated using a weighted overlap formula to give you an accurate view of portfolio concentration.</p><p>For funds A and B, with constituents {i} and weights wA_i, wB_i (as fractions of total portfolio):<br/><code>WeightedOverlap = Σ_i min(wA_i, wB_i)</code></p><h3>Worked Example</h3><p>To calculate the overlap between 'ICICI Pru Bluechip' (Fund A) and 'HDFC Top 100' (Fund B), we sum the minimum weight for each common stock. Here are the top 5:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Stock</th><th>Fund A (wA %)</th><th>Fund B (wB %)</th><th>Min(wA, wB)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ICICI Bank</td><td>9.95</td><td>6.73</td><td>6.73</td></tr><tr><td>Reliance Industries</td><td>9.54</td><td>5.50</td><td>5.50</td></tr><tr><td>HDFC Bank</td><td>6.21</td><td>9.32</td><td>6.21</td></tr><tr><td>Infosys</td><td>5.14</td><td>4.07</td><td>4.07</td></tr><tr><td>Larsen & Toubro</td><td>4.43</td><td>3.31</td><td>3.31</td></tr><tr><td><em>...

For any discrepancies, please refer to the official fund factsheet from the respective Asset Management Company (AMC).</li><li><strong>Exclusions:</strong> Non-equity holdings such as cash, debt instruments, and other receivables (e.g., 'TREPS') are excluded from the calculation to ensure a true equity-to-equity comparison.</li><li><strong>Coverage:</strong> If a fund's disclosed holdings do not sum to at least 80% of its total assets, a 'partial coverage' warning is shown, as the calculated overlap may not be fully representative.</li></ul>"

    "faq": {
      "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "faqs": [
        { "q": "What is mutual fund overlap?", "a": "Mutual fund overlap occurs when two or more of your funds hold the same stocks, which can lead to 'false diversification' and concentrated risk. Our calculator helps you identify these common holdings." },
        { "q": "How do you calculate mutual fund overlap %?", "a": "We use a weighted overlap formula by summing the minimum weight of each common stock between funds. This gives a more accurate measure of concentration than simple counts." },
        { "q": "How much overlap is too much between two mutual funds?", "a": "Generally, an overlap above 30% is considered high and warrants a review. Above 50-60% is very high, suggesting the funds are too similar and you should consider consolidating to avoid duplicate costs." },
        { "q": "How to check overlap between two mutual funds in India?", "a": "Use our free Mutual Fund Overlap Calculator. Simply select your Indian mutual funds in the tool to get an instant analysis of common stocks and sector concentration." },
        { "q": "Does sector overlap matter more than stock overlap?", "a": "Both matter, but high stock-level overlap is a bigger red flag. High sector overlap (e.g., both funds are 30% in Financials) is common, but if they both hold the exact same banks, your risk is more concentrated." },
        { "q": "Can SIPs in different funds create high overlap?", "a": "Yes. If you run SIPs in multiple large-cap or flexi-cap funds that track similar benchmarks (like the Nifty 50), they will likely buy the same top stocks, leading to high portfolio overlap over time." },
        { "q": "How often should I check overlap for my portfolio?", "a": "A yearly portfolio review is a good practice. Check for overlap annually or whenever you are considering adding a new fund to ensure it's adding true diversification." },
        { "q": "How to reduce overlap without changing my asset allocation?", "a": "You can 'steer' your SIPs by pausing contributions to a high-overlap fund and redirecting the amount to a more unique fund in the same category (e.g., a 'value' fund instead of a 'growth' fund) or a different market focus (e.g., a multi-cap fund)." },
        { "q": "Is fund overlap the same as correlation?", "a": "No. Overlap measures common holdings, while correlation measures how similarly the funds' NAVs move. High overlap often leads to high correlation, but funds can be correlated without having high overlap." },
        { "q": "Can overlap increase my downside risk during a crash?", "a": "Yes. High overlap concentrates your risk. If a specific stock or sector that is common across all your funds performs badly, your entire portfolio will suffer more than you might expect." },
        { "q": "Are international funds included in overlap calculations?", "a": "Yes, our tool can calculate overlap for any funds in our database, including international ones, as long as the data is available." },
        { "q": "What date are fund holdings taken from? How often are they updated?", "a": "The holdings in our database are based on the latest available data from fund factsheets, typically updated monthly or quarterly." },
        { "q": "Is mutual fund overlap taxable?", "a": "The overlap itself is not taxable. However, if you decide to sell a fund to reduce overlap, any capital gains from that sale will be taxed (Short-Term or Long-Term Capital Gains, depending on the holding period)." },
        { "q": "Can I use this calculator for 5+ funds?", "a": "The user interface is optimized for comparing up to 5 funds at once for clarity. For a larger portfolio review, you can perform multiple comparisons." },
        { "q": "What to do if two funds overlap 60%+?", "a": "An overlap of over 60% suggests the funds are nearly identical. It is highly recommended to consolidate. Choose the fund with the better long-term performance and lower expense ratio, and consider switching your SIP and holdings to that single fund." },
        { "q": "Do you provide an API / embeddable widget?", "a": "This feature is not currently available, but we are considering it for the future. For now, you can link directly to our calculator page." },
        { "q": "How accurate is the overlap calculation?", "a": "The calculation is mathematically precise based on the holdings data in our database. The accuracy depends on how recent the data is from the AMCs. We strive to keep it updated." },
        { "q": "How to replace a fund with a low-overlap alternative?", "a": "First, identify the category of the fund you want to replace (e.g., Large-Cap). Then, research other funds in that category with a different investment style (e.g., a 'value' fund instead of a 'growth' fund) or a different market focus (e.g., a multi-cap fund)." },
        { "q": "How do expense ratios affect the overlap decision?", "a": "High overlap means you are paying multiple fund managers (and multiple expense ratios) to own the same stocks. If two funds have high overlap, it often makes sense to consolidate into the one with the lower expense ratio to save on costs." },
        { "q": "What is the weighted-overlap formula and why is it better?", "a": "The weighted-overlap formula is: Sum of [Minimum Weight of Stock X in Fund A vs Fund B]. It's better than just counting common stocks because it measures the *actual* portfolio concentration, giving more importance to stocks with a higher weight in both funds." }

      },
      { "question": "What is the maximum deposit allowed in PPF?", "answer": "You can deposit a maximum of â‚¹1,50,000 in a single financial year." },
      { "question": "Can I extend my PPF after 15 years?", "answer": "Yes, you can extend your PPF account in blocks of 5 years with or without making further contributions. An extended account with contributions continues to earn tax-free interest on the entire balance." },
      { "question": "Can I open multiple PPF accounts?", "answer": "No, an individual can only open one PPF account in their name." },
      { "question": "How is PPF interest calculated monthly?", "answer": "Interest is calculated on the lowest balance between the close of the fifth day and the last day of every month. However, the interest is credited to the account only at the end of the financial year." },
      { "question": "Is there any penalty for missed deposits?", "answer": "If you fail to deposit the minimum amount of â‚¹500 in a financial year, the account becomes inactive. You can reactivate it by paying a penalty of â‚¹50 per year of inactivity, along with the minimum deposit for each inactive year." },
      { "question": "How is PPF different from Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY)?", "answer": "PPF is a general long-term savings scheme for any resident Indian, while SSY is specifically designed for the financial security of a girl child. SSY typically offers a slightly higher interest rate but has stricter eligibility criteria." }

Use this calculator to see how small, consistent investments can grow into a significant, tax-free corpus over time."
